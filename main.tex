	\item  \label{item:abstract motion to field}
	assume the motion is described by
	\begin{align}
	\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{c},t)=\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{c})h(t)
	\end{align}
	find the expression of the velocity  field $\mathbf{v}$.
	
	\item
	assume the motion is
	\begin{align}
	x=ct^2
	\end{align}
	use the result of \ref{item:abstract motion to field},find the expression of the velocity  field $v$.
	\item
	suppose in a one dimensional flow, the motion of the $c$th fluid element is given by
	 \begin{equation}
		x=f(c,t)
	\end{equation}
	and the temperature of the flow at time $t$ is distributed as
	\begin{equation}
	T=g(x,t)
	\end{equation} 
	find the temperature variation rate of the $c$th element.
	\item
	The velocity components in an unsteady plane flow are given by
	\begin{align}
	u=\frac{x}{1+t}\\
	v=\frac{2y}{2+t}
	\end{align}
	find the path lines and the streamlines equation subjecting to $\mathbf{x = x_0}$ at $t = 0$.
	
	\item
	Let a one-dimensional velocity field be $u = u(x, t)$. The density varies as $\rho = \rho_0(2 -\cos \omega t)$. Find an expression for $u(x, t)$
	if $u(0, t) = U$.
	
	\item
	The components of a mass flow vector $\rho\mathbf{ u}$ are $\rho u = 4x^2y$, $\rho v = xyz$,
	$\rho w = yz^2$. Compute the net outflow through the closed surface formed by the planes
	$x = 0, x = 1, y = 0, y = 1, z = 0, z = 1$.
	(a) Integrate over the closed surface.
	(b) Integrate over the volume bounded by that surface.

	\item
	Water flows through a pipe in a gravitational field as shown in the accompanying figure. Neglect the effects of viscosity and surface tension. Solve the appropriate
	conservation equations for the variation of the cross-sectional area of the fluid column
	$A(z)$ after the water has left the pipe at $z = 0$. The velocity of the fluid at $z = 0$ is
	uniform at $v_0$ and the cross-sectional area is $A_0$

	\item
	A two-dimensional object is placed in a $2h$-wide water
	tunnel as shown. The upstream velocity, $v_1$ , is uniform across the
	cross section. For the downstream velocity profile as shown, find
	the value of $v_2$

	\item
	consider fluid in  a channel of unit width and that the vertical velocity of the fluid  is negligible and the horizontal velocity $u(x,t)$ is roughly constant throughout any cross section of the channel.assume the fluid is incompressible so the density $\rho$ is constant,denote the depth of the fluid as $h(x,t)$ find the mass and momentum conserve equation of the fluid(the gravitational constant is $g$).
